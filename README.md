## Arduino_Based_Maze_Solving_Robot
I was the leader in the group project that involves using Arduino uno to turn a 4 wheeled robot into a maze-solver robot that uses 3 ultrasonic sensors to determine if there's an obstacle on left, right or front of it.
The original robot uses 4 DC motors to move and with the help of L293D (H-bridge).
## Obstacle_avoidance_on_inclined_plane_Robot
This was a contest to make the fastest robot to reach the top of the inclined plane while avoiding all obstacles too. 
My team won the competition.
## Pick_and_place_robot_simulation_using_Coppeliasim
This project was carried out by using coppeliasim to create a full pick and place scene using 2 arm robots, this was controlled and tested by two methods. The first one was using the coppeliasim itself and the second by using Jupyter Notebook (VREP) and Python programming language.
## See_Speak_using_Raspberry-pi
The project was done by using a Raspberry pi 3 module B and a Raspberry pi camera module V3, also a set of speakers to capture a picture, analyze and identify texts in it, convert it into a text file and then finally read the text out loud.
